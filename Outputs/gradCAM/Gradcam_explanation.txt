Case 1: True: clear_sky | Pred: stormy (0.47) [Incorrect]
Explanation: The model incorrectly predicted 'stormy' with low confidence. The uniform blue GradCAM heatmap indicates the model struggled to find specific, localized features in the image to support this (incorrect) prediction at the target layer. This often happens with low-confidence predictions, confusing inputs (like glare), or when gradient signals become very diffuse in later layers, resulting in minimal activation for the CAM calculation.
Case 2: True: rainy | Pred: rainy (0.48) [Correct]
Explanation: The model correctly identified the scene as 'rainy', though with moderate confidence. The GradCAM heatmap highlights several relevant areas: primarily the low, dark clouds close to the horizon and potentially the streaks/texture on the water surface. This shows the model focused on features typically associated with rainy weather to make its decision.
Case 3: True: stormy | Pred: stormy (0.85) [Correct]
Explanation: The model correctly predicted 'stormy' with high confidence. However, the GradCAM heatmap is uniformly blue, failing to highlight specific local regions. This can sometimes occur with Vision Transformers or specific target layers, especially for large, dominant features like this single cloud. It might suggest the model's decision relied on more global context or feature relationships captured before the target layer, or the distinguishing gradient signals were averaged out at this final stage.
Case 4: True: cloudy | Pred: cloudy (0.73) [Correct]
Explanation: The model correctly classified the image as 'cloudy' with good confidence. The GradCAM heatmap shows the model focused on several distinct cloud patches scattered across the sky as evidence, with particularly high activation (red/yellow) on the brighter cloud formation on the upper right. This demonstrates the model identified multiple regions containing clouds to arrive at its prediction.
